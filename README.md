# cs4220-s20

This is the course material repository for Cornell [CS 4220][cs4220]
for the Spring 2017 semester.  This repository will contain lecture
notes, homework assignments, reference codes, utilities, and the
source for the class web site.  Feel free to use the code, TeX files,
or other materials here; also, feel free to post pull requests if you
see items that ought to be corrected.

Note: I encourage you to use Git for your own work, but please do *not*
put your assignment solutions in public [GitHub][gh] repositories.
Note that [GitHub][gh] and [BitBucket][bb] both offer private repositories;
I typically use [BitBucket][bb] for this purpose.
